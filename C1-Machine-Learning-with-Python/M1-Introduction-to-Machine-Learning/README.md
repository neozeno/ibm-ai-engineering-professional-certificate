# Introduction to Machine Learning

This is module 1 of the [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python?specialization=ai-engineer) course.

In this module, I explored foundational machine learning concepts
that prepared me for hands-on modeling with Python.
I learned the relevance of Python and scikit-learn in machine learning,
summarized the IBM AI Engineering certification path,
and classified common types of learning algorithms.
I also outlined the stages of the machine learning model lifecycle
and described what a typical day looks like for a machine learning engineer.
I was also able to compare key roles in the AI field,
identify widely used open-source tools, and learn to utilize scikit-learn
to build and evaluate simple models.
