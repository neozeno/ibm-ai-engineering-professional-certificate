# Machine Learning with Python

[Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python?specialization=ai-engineer)
is the first course of the [IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer).

Python is a core skill in machine learning, and this course equipped me
with the tools to apply it effectively. I learned key ML concepts,
how to build models with scikit-learn, and gained hands-on experience
using Jupyter Notebooks. 

The course started with regression techniques like linear, multiple linear,
polynomial, and logistic regression. Then moved into supervised models
such as decision trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and support vector machines.
I also explored unsupervised learning, including clustering methods
and dimensionality reduction with PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. 

Through real-world labs, I was able to practice model evaluation,
cross-validation, regularization, and pipeline optimization.
A final project on rainfall prediction and a course-wide exam helped me apply
and reinforce my skills.

## What I Learned

- Explain key concepts, tools, and roles involved in machine learning,
  including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
- Apply core machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification,
  clustering, and dimensionality reduction using Python and scikit-learn.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics, validation strategies,
  and optimization techniques. 
- Build and assess end-to-end machine learning solutions on real-world datasets
  through hands-on labs, projects, and practical evaluations.
