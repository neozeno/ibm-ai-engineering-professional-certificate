# IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate

In this [IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer)
I learned to build, train, and deploy different types of deep architectures,
including convolutional neural networks, recurrent networks, autoencoders,
and generative AI models including large language models (LLMs).

I mastered fundamental concepts of machine learning and deep learning,
including supervised and unsupervised learning, using Python.
I applied popular libraries such as SciPy, ScikitLearn, Keras, PyTorch,
and TensorFlow to industry problems using object recognition, computer vision,
image and video processing, text analytics, natural language processing (NLP),
and recommender systems. I also built Generative AI applications using LLMs
and RAG with frameworks like Hugging Face and LangChain.
